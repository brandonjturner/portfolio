            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMy name is Brandon Turner and I was born on September 2nd, 1988.  I have been interested in computers since I was a child using old parts from my Fathers work as toys. The computer chips looked like a little city.

            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspI started building my own computers when I was 12 and got into video editing shortly after.  From video editing I got into 2D effects.  After that I moved on to 3D effects. After that I got into web development creating my first working page in 2000.  I sold my first website in 2004 and from then on I was hooked.
